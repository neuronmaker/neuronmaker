I am Dalton, interested in most things related to electronics.

My main OpenPGP key fingerprint is: 167E 19AC B8E5 38F3 2FD2  2766 81C9 678A 0987 8230
I also have an alternate OpenPGP key based on Ed25519 keys if you prefer.
My secondary PGP key dingerprint is: 1F32 5206 DE34 CFCF 0022  D045 48A7 3B8C 8920 7930
I will use the above key for most things. If in doubt use the above key to communicate with me. 

I will keep things like my OpenPGP public keys and other profile worthy things here as my current main
place to store those things.

In the event you wish to reach out to me, I usually prefer encrypted messaging formats such as OpenPGP
or Signal. I am hesitant to publish my phone number since I already recieve 2-3 scam calls per day, so
Signal would be hard for me to share outside circles of people who walready know me. OpenPGP is fairly
secure and I make a constant effort to keep my public key available. My email address is already public
knowledge thanks to publishing apps on teh Play Store (your email address is one of the thinkgs Google
places on the store page), hence I am willing to publish my email address in my public key.
