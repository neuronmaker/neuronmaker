Who I am
========

I am Dalton, a student who enjoys programming. I also advocate for access
to security and privacy tools. We live in a unique time in which almost
anyone can use tools that were recently considered mere science fiction.

## Contact

I will not publish my phone number for privacy and security reasons.
Phone numbers are not very secure, and communications using phone numbers
are not private at all. I have published my email address and my OpenPGP
keys. Email is also not a secure or private communication system, but
OpenPGP will give *pretty good privacy* for the content of an email
message. I prefer to communicate over encrypted channels whenever possible.

Encryption is a wonderful tool. It can and should be used by everyone.
Privacy and security are both a team effort. Protecting yourself provides
everyone else a form of "herd immunity".

### Secure messengers
Below is my Session ID if you have the [Session app](https://getsession.org/)
installed.

### OpenPGP


I use two OpenPGP keys, one is based on ```RSA``` and the other on
```Ed25519```. I strongly prefer to use the ```Ed25519``` key, but I
maintain the second ```RSA``` key for communicating with people using
older software which cannot use ```Ed25519``` keys.

Below are the fingerprints for both keys.

#### Ed25519

```1F32 5206 DE34 CFCF 0022 D045 48A7 3B8C 8920 7930```

#### RSA4096

```167E 19AC B8E5 38F3 2FD2 2766 81C9 678A 0987 8230```

I will reply using whichever key you sent me the messsage with.

Both keys are available on this repository, and also on other
platforms like Keybase and some Web Key Directory (WKD) servers.
