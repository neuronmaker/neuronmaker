I am Dalton, interested in most things related to electronics.

My main OpenPGP key fingerprint is: 167E 19AC B8E5 38F3 2FD2  2766 81C9 678A 0987 8230
I will use the above key for most things. If in doubt use the above key to communicate with me. 

I will keep things like my OpenPGP public keys and other profile worthy things here as my current main place to store those things.

If for any reason you reach out to me via email or any other realtively unsecure channel I kindly request you do so using OpenPGP to protect the communication and keep the body of the messages readable only to the intended recipants (us in this case).
