Hash: SHA512

I have two OpenPGP keys, one is based on the RSA system and the other one is
based on the newer Ed25519 system. Both keys should work with most systems
since they were generated using a modern version of GPG (Gnu Privacy Guard).
However, some key-servers and clients do not support the newer and more
efficient Ed25519 keys. Therefore, I maintain an RSA key for communicating
with people who use those clients.

Here are the key fingerprints.
Ed25519 based key: 1F32 5206 DE34 CFCF 0022  D045 48A7 3B8C 8920 7930
RSA4096 based key: 167E 19AC B8E5 38F3 2FD2  2766 81C9 678A 0987 8230

I consider both to be equally valid, but I prefer to use my Ed25519 key for
the smaller and faster signatures. The security of Ed25519 is respectable and
more than "good enough" until something that is quantum resistant is
published.

If your software works with my Ed25519 key, then use that one to communicate
with me. If your software does not accept my Ed25519 key, then use my RSA key
instead.

At some point, quantum resistant algorithms will be available. Once that
happens, I will post a digitally signed message (like this one) which will
have information about my new key in it. Hopefully, OpenPGP software like GPG
will swiftly adopt such a key so that there is sufficient time for developers
to migrate to the new algorithms.
