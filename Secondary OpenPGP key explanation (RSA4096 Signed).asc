Hash: SHA512

I have two OpenPGP keys, one using Ed25519 and one using RSA. Ed25519 and Curve25519 keys are smaller and
take less time to be generated than their RSA counterparts. Additionally, it takes less computing time to
use them and their signatures are also smaller than the RSA counterparts. I prefer to use my Ed25519 key
for the reason of speed and size of signatures and encrypted data. However, some older software does not
work correctly with Ed25519 keys, hence I also have an RSA key for these "edge cases" where some software
refuses to use Ed25519.

Here are the key fingerprints.
Ed25519 based key: 1F32 5206 DE34 CFCF 0022  D045 48A7 3B8C 8920 7930
RSA4096 based key: 167E 19AC B8E5 38F3 2FD2  2766 81C9 678A 0987 8230

I consider both to be equally valid, but I prefer to use my Ed25519 key due to efficiency reasons. The
security of Ed25519 is respectable and more than "good enough" until something quantum resistant comes
around.

Which key should you use to communicate with me? If your software works with my Ed25519 key then you should
use that one, if there are issues, that is the reason I keep an RSA key as well.

At some point, quantum resistant keys will be available, these keys will be able to resist cracking by quantum 
computers which is somehting that our current keys are not able to do at this time. When this
happens, I will post a signed message notifying of my migration. Lets all hope that those algorithms are
available shortly.
