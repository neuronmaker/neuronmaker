Hash: SHA512

I am updating my public key file here.
There are two keys that are mine, one is RSA4096 for the master and all subkeys and the other is using
Ed25519 keys. Both are valid, use the RSA if you are unsure since RSA keys tend to be compatible with
more PGP handler applications. You should use the elliptical curve key if you want to take advantage of
the key being smaller, most things the key makes being smaller, and elliptical curves tend to consume
less CPU time to do encryption or verify signatures. I will use both keys but because of compatibility
the default is the RSA key, but I will use whichever key is preferred. The Elliptical curve key is more
to be considered a backup in case something breaks RSA keys but does not break elliptical curve keys.
This version will have two blocks with the top block being the RSA key and the bottom being the
Elliptical curve key. The reason is in case an older PGP handler like an old version of GPG is unable to
import Ed25519 keys then the RSA key will still work and will still be possible to import and use.

Here are the key fingerprints.
RSA4096 based key: 167E 19AC B8E5 38F3 2FD2  2766 81C9 678A 0987 8230
Ed25519 based key: 1F32 5206 DE34 CFCF 0022  D045 48A7 3B8C 8920 7930

I consider both to be equally valid but I will use the RSA4096 to sign things because more clients
should support RSA4096 than Ed25519. However, if you send me something encrypted to my Ed25519 key I
will sign my responses with the Ed25519 key since I with use which ever key is requested of me to use.

Which key should you use to encrypt things to? Up to you. Default to the RSA4096 key since that should
be more compatible with more clients but all of my software will work with either key type so use which
is most convenient for you.
